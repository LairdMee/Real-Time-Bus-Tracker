The improvement is creating a new, second bus zone that's red and runs in a different zone than the MIT Harvard zone, which is indicated with a  blue marker.The new red marker bus zone includes 7 stops from MIT to Northeastern University, which is the final destination. The purpose of adding this new zone is to compare the schedules of two buses in two different zones.
